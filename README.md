# About

The approach for this project was to use GitHub's traditional black and white colors to spin off a playful look for a web-app that displays a user's GitHub stats such as followers, repos, etc. I wanted to spend more time on the optional features, but was running short on time. (thanks, finals)

I do think there could be a better solution created for the grid system I have in place.
